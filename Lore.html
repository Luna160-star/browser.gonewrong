        <h3> LORE </h3>
    <p>
         This game is based on a futuristic idea. <br>
        It's 2040, and Iven finds a broken computer, it barely was functioning.
        User finds it interesting and starts exploring the old computer only to find an old game?
        But the screen seems to get stuck in the game and the only way to leave it was to solve the puzzles and leave it.
        Help Iven in solving puzzles and out this weird game.
